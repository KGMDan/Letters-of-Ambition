_A slow-burn, epistolary TTRPG of secrets, desires, and handwritten schemes._
## [Character Creation](/Letters-of-Ambition/Character-Creation.md)
Every player creates a character defined by two traits:
### Dark Secret
Known **only** to you. It is the heart of your character’s identity and a dangerous truth that, if exposed, could ruin you. Protect it at all costs.
### Grand Ambition
Public and shared with all players. This is your character’s goal—why they write letters, what they hope to accomplish, and the power they seek.

## [[Character Letters]] & [[The Host & World Letters]]
The game unfolds entirely through **letters**, written in-character and shared among players.
### The Rotating Host
Each week, one player becomes the **Host**. The Host writes **two letters per day**:
- **World Letter**  
    Written in the voice of the world—a newspaper, a whispering network, a royal decree, etc. This sets the tone for the day, presents rumors or events, and gives players something to respond to.
- **Character Letter**  
    A personal letter written from the Host’s character to another player or the group.

**Important:** The World Letter must be sent **first** each week to give players proper narrative context and inspiration.

---
## The [[Card Draw]]
Every time a player writes a letter, they draw a **single card** from a standard deck (including Jokers). This card defines the **theme** and **tone** of their letter.
### Number Cards (2–9): Strength of Theme
- **2** – Subtle or faint influence
- **9** – Overwhelming, near-madness intensity
### Suits: Theme of the Letter
- **❤️ Hearts** – Emotions and relationships
- **♦ Diamonds** – Wealth, status, and resources
- **♣ Clubs** – Danger, violence, and conflict
- **♠ Spades** – Your **secret** must take center stage

When you draw a card, its **suit defines the core theme** of your letter. The **value determines how strong or disruptive** that theme is.

## Aces – Specific Actions (Mandatory)
Aces override the usual structure. You **must** include the following action in your letter:
- **Ace of Hearts** – _Heart Revealed_  
    You feel compelled to confess something personal or emotional—an admission of guilt, love, or fear.
- **Ace of Diamonds** – _Sudden Gain_  
    You discover an opportunity for wealth, power, or influence—perhaps a job, favor, or valuable information.
- **Ace of Clubs** – _Strike or Struck_  
    Someone (or something) attacks you—or you attack first. This can be physical, political, or social.
- **Ace of Spades** – _Unwelcome Truth_  
    You uncover something that conflicts with your secret or your ambition. How do you handle it?

## Face Cards – Broader Complications
These cards carry **narrative weight** and introduce a shift in tone or perception:
- **Jack** – _Shadows Move_  
    You feel watched. Someone may be spying on you, or you sense danger lurking just out of view.
- **Queen** – _Infatuation_  
    You become obsessed—with a person, idea, or object. It clouds or sharpens your judgment.
- **King** – _The World Takes Notice_  
    Your actions—or inaction—have drawn attention. Someone, somewhere, is watching.  
    Your letter must reflect this shift: Are you being praised? Feared? Targeted?

---

## Jokers – Wild Events
- **Red Joker** – _A Miracle Occurs_  
    Something wondrous or impossible happens—positive, surreal, or divine.
- **Black Joker** – _A Catastrophe Strikes_  
    Something devastating changes the world’s course—war, natural disaster, betrayal, collapse.

Use these sparingly; they are **major world-shifting events**.

---

## Letters Must Be Physical
As part of the game’s immersive, anti-AI aesthetic, **All letters must be handwritten, scanned, or photographed.** Your handwriting becomes part of your character's voice—flourished or frantic, elegant or crude.

---
## Session Zero: [[Building the World]]
Begin your campaign with a live, collaborative session (voice/video preferred) to flesh out the setting:
1. **The World**  
    Is it fantastical or mundane? Magical, post-apocalyptic, political intrigue, or steampunk noir? Decide the tone and genre together.
2. **The Setting**  
    Focus on the **city, town, or region** where the characters reside. Define its landmarks, factions, power structures, and history.
3. **Flashpoints**  
    Establish **potential points of conflict**: social unrest, political succession, forbidden knowledge, unstable magic, economic collapse, etc. These serve as narrative fuel that may ignite during the game.

---
## [[Elimination]]
If your **dark secret is discovered**, you are **eliminated** from the game. This could mean public disgrace, assassination, exile, imprisonment—whatever the fiction demands. The consequences are real and final.

---
## Slow Play for Deep Drama
This is a game of **long arcs**, **slow tension**, and **intimate revelations**. Letters might be poetic, rambling, clipped, or desperate. Secrets will slip. Alliances will shift.

Play to uncover truth—yours and others'.  
Write boldly. Hide well.
