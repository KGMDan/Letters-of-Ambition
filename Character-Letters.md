# Character Letters
After the World Letter is sent, every character write one **personal** letter from your own character.

Your letter is your voice in this world. It's how you make allies, deceive enemies, steer events, and reveal pieces of yourself—carefully, or not. Each week, you’ll write **one physical letter**, in-character, based on a **card draw** and the events of the current **World Letter**.
### Your Character
Before you write a single word, ground yourself in your character:
- **What is your Dark Secret?**  
    Even if no one else knows it, it should color everything you write. Paranoia, guilt, boldness, overcompensation—your secret drives how you present yourself.
- **What is your Grand Ambition?**  
    Every letter is a move. A way to get closer to your goal—or protect it.  
    Ask yourself: _Is this letter helping me rise, deceive, gain influence, or strike first?_

Keep these two core truths at the heart of your correspondence. When your lost look back to you characters core and the letters you've already written!
### [[Card Draw]]: The Prompt
Each letter is guided by a **single playing card**. This gives shape to your writing. It’s not a limitation—it’s an **inspiration**. It suggests the tone, focus, and energy of your letter.

#### The Value (2–9) 
Represents the **intensity** of the influence.
- **2**: A small, passing mention
- **5**: A central but moderate theme
- **9**: Overwhelming. A breakdown. An obsession. Something you can’t hide.
### Suit (Theme)  
Determines the core focus of your letter:

|Suit|Theme|Example Focus|
|---|---|---|
|❤️ Hearts|Relationships & Emotions|Love, betrayal, longing, grief, trust|
|♦️ Diamonds|Wealth & Resources|Money, status, property, luxury, scarcity|
|♣️ Clubs|Conflict & Danger|Threats, violence, strategy, suspicion|
|♠️ Spades|Your Secret|Lies, revelations, paranoia, concealment|
**Interpret Freely!** You don’t have to write literally about “money” or “fighting.” Use the theme to color your message:
- A **3 of Diamonds** might be a gentle comment on someone’s spending habits.
- A **9 of Spades** might be a frantic attempt to throw suspicion off your trail!
#### Face Cards: Drama Rises
Face cards come with added narrative pressure. Use them to stir complications and deepen the intrigue. Note that face cards are also influenced by the suit they belong to.

|Card|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Jack**|Something from the shadows. Are you being spied on? Is someone testing your loyalty? Your letter should reflect unease.|
|**Queen**|Infatuation. You become obsessed with a person, idea, or thing—show that infatuation bleeding through your words.|
|**King**|You’ve drawn attention. A powerful figure or force is now watching you. Is it admiration? Scrutiny? Threat?|
#### Aces: Mandates
An Ace is not a suggestion—it’s an event that must appear in your letter. Build the letter around it. Like face cards they are also influenced by the suit they belong too!

|Ace|Required Element|
|---|---|
|**Ace of Hearts** ❤️|You feel compelled to admit something personal or emotional. A confession, perhaps unintended.|
|**Ace of Diamonds** ♦️|You gain—or believe you’ve gained—access to new wealth, opportunity, or social status.|
|**Ace of Clubs** ♣️|You are attacked, directly or indirectly. A blade, a threat, a legal strike.|
|**Ace of Spades** ♠️|You uncover something that directly threatens your Secret or Ambition. Do you reveal it—or lie?|
#### Jokers: Extremes

|Joker|Event|
|---|---|
|**Red Joker** ❤️|A miracle occurs. Healing, luck, divine intervention, an impossible chance made real.|
|**Black Joker** ♠️|A catastrophe. Collapse, fire, plague, exposure, betrayal. The world turns against you.|
These should dramatically shape the letter—and the world.
### React to the World Letter
Your letter must be a **response to something in the World Letter**. This connects all players to a shared timeline and builds cohesion.

**Choose one element** from the World Letter to react to:
- A named event: _"The inspection at the docks..."_
- A rumor: _"Did you hear what they say about the statue of Makarus?"_
- A conflict: _"Trade routes are shuttered—this changes everything."_
- A subtle detail: _"Who is this Marien Allweather, really?"_

This becomes the **frame** for your letter. Your card gives it **flavor**. Your secret and ambition give it **purpose**.
## Letters of [[Elimination]] & Blackmail
Some letters are more dangerous than others. When you suspect a secret—or worse, when you **know**—your character may choose to act. These moments define the power and peril of the game. 

A **letter of elimination** is a public accusation. It must reveal, with specificity, the **nature of the target's Dark Secret**. This is not a vague threat—it is a blade laid bare in writing.

**Your letter should:**
- Name the recipient clearly.
- Reveal the heart of their secret (or come close enough).
- Be written in the voice of your character—angry, smug, regretful, or cold.
- Include a sense of consequence: the damage their exposure causes, whether social, political, or physical.

The letter can be sent directly to the accused, an non-player authority or faction or, ideally, published publicly via the **World Letter** if you're the Host. Once the letter is sent, the accused must decide:   **Is the accusation close enough to the truth?**  
If yes—they are eliminated. If no—they may deny, deflect, or retaliate.

A **blackmail letter** is quieter. It whispers instead of shouts. It's a move to gain leverage—through implication, veiled threat, or subtle offer. 

**Your letter should:**
- Hint at knowledge of the recipient’s secret.
- Offer a demand, deal, or silence... for now.
- Leave just enough ambiguity to keep them unsure of what you _truly_ know.

Use tone as your weapon—be polite, mocking, or coldly transactional. A good blackmail draws your target into a game of control, forcing them to write back, react, or scheme in turn. But beware—if you push too hard, you may provoke an elimination attempt… on _you_.

Use these moments sparingly. Letters of blackmail and elimination are **climaxes**—use them when the time feels earned, and the drama is ripe. The slow unravelling is just as important as the final blow.
### Writing Tips
- **Stay in voice.** Use tone, language, and style that fits your character—sarcastic, affectionate, haughty, cryptic.
- **Write to someone.** Your letter is addressed to another character. You don’t need their reply yet—write as if they’re reading this alone.
- **Play with subtext.** Hide meanings between the lines. Use false flattery, or deny too much. Invite intrigue.
- **Use visual cues.** Is your handwriting neat or frantic? Ink color? Scented paper? Embellishments? All part of the fiction.
- **Don’t explain your secret—evade, mislead, obscure.** But hint at it. Let cracks show.
- **Take risks.** Tell a lie. Ask a favor. Make an accusation. Give the other players something to work with.
### In Short
1. **Find your character**, remember who they are, how they think.
2. **Draw a card**—suit = theme, value = intensity.
3. **Read the World Letter** and choose **one part** to respond to.
4. **Write a physical letter** in your character’s voice.
5. **Keep your secret hidden**, but let it leak at the edges.
6. **Pursue your ambition**, one sentence at a time.
## Example Letter

##### Context 
**Card Drawn**: 7♠ (Seven of Spades)  
The player is writing in response to the _World Letter_, which mentioned the mysterious disappearance of a city archivist and growing rumors about forged documents related to land ownership in the Noble Quarter.

**Character**:  
**Name**: Corvin Bellhart  
**Grand Ambition**: To establish the Bellhart name among the noble houses by acquiring land and patronage through clever deals and social maneuvering.  
**Dark Secret**: Corvin is not a Bellhart at all, but a servant who stole the name (and identity) of a real noble after the latter’s mysterious death abroad.
#### The Letter
My Dearest Lady Veyra,

Your latest letter finds me both warmed and troubled. Your words, as ever, are sharp in wit and gentle in kindness—a balm upon a week otherwise riddled with unease.

I do not know if you have heard (though I suspect your ears are better than mine), but Master Eldreth of the City Archives has vanished. His desk was overturned, and they say a bloodied scrap of cloth was found caught in the drawers. How terrible. How _interesting_.

The timing, you must admit, is uncanny. Just last month, I submitted final copies of the Bellhart deed records to his office—land that, as you know, I acquired through many tangled channels. And now… the registrar vanishes? What whispers may follow that?

There are stirrings, Veyra. I overheard the florists outside Couriers' Row murmuring about a “false scion.” A bastard prince? A traitor heir? Gods know what legends the cobbles birth. But my name—_our_ name—has surfaced in them more than once. I begin to wonder who has started digging... and why.

Should you find yourself invited to Lord Argen's estate this week (as I suspect you shall be), do me the kindness of watching who speaks too freely about lands west of the Alms Gate. I suspect more eyes than mine are upon them.

And upon me.

Yours,  **Corvin**

**Enclosed:** A pressed violet (the flower of House Bellhart), dried and a little wilted.
