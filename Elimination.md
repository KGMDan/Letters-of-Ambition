# Elimination
At the heart of this game is risk: your **Dark Secret** is your foundation—but also your greatest vulnerability.

If another player **publicly reveals** your secret in the World Letter while they’re Host or a letter reporting you to a faction or an authority as a character, your character risks being **eliminated** from the story. Elimination doesn’t have to mean death—it could be **assassination**, **exile**, **imprisonment**, **disgrace**, or **vanishing under mysterious circumstances**. The nature of your downfall should suit the tone of your secret and the world.
### How Secrets Are Revealed
A secret can only be publicly revealed through a **letter**. This may take the form of:
- A character writing an open accusation to another
- A “leaked” letter published in the World Letter by the Host
- A direct confrontation where someone outlines what they’ve pieced together

The accusation must be specific enough that **everyone at the table** can recognize the intent. (“You’ve worn another man’s name too long, Bellhart,” or “Strange how every fire traces back to you, isn’t it?”)

Once revealed, it is up to the **accused player** to decide:
> “Is this accusation close enough to the truth?”

If **yes**, they accept elimination and narrate or collaborate on their character’s exit from the story.  
If **no**, they may **deny it**, continue playing, and potentially twist the accusation into a false lead or red herring. Be careful though—next time the evidence may be stronger.
### Blackmail, Threats, and Power Plays
Secrets don’t have to be revealed right away. You may also **blackmail**, **threaten**, or **manipulate** another player by alluding to their secret. This might look like:

- Veiled threats in letters (“I wonder what Lord Neris would say if he knew who really held the matches…”)
- Demanding favors, bribes, or silence in return for discretion
- Turning public opinion subtly against someone through the World Letter

A good blackmail keeps your opponent guessing—do you really know, or are you bluffing?
### The Risk of Playing Close to the Fire
The more a character engages with the world—especially Spades-related prompts—the more likely they are to leave clues. Every card draw, every letter, and every alliance carries the risk of exposure but, that same risk is what makes ambition meaningful. If your secret falls, let it fall dramatically.
