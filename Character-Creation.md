Each player steps into the world through the voice of a single character—a person with **something to hide** and **something they want deeply**.

Your letters will be shaped by these twin forces:
### Dark Secret
Your Dark Secret is **private**—no one but you should know it. It defines who you are beneath the surface: your shame, your crime, your hidden past, your forbidden desire. If exposed, it will destroy your plans… or you.
#### It may be:
- A crime you committed or covered up
- A betrayal you’re trying to make right
- A hidden identity, lineage, or magical nature
- A past allegiance to a forbidden group
- A secret love or obsession
- An illness, curse, or debt you're concealing
- The fact that your Grand Ambition is a lie

The world doesn't need to know everything yet—but you must know. Write it down and keep it secret.

The Dark Secret is a way to causes trouble for your character, any one that knows it can use it against you blackmailing you with it. If a player elect to openly uncover your secret to the whole group your character faces [[Elimination]], the untimely end of you story!
### Grand Ambition
This is **public**—shared with the group. It defines what your character is striving for and why they write letters. It should be big, dramatic, and compelling. You're not writing idle correspondence—you are moving toward a **goal**.

Your **Grand Ambition** is your guiding light—but it should remain just out of reach. Tension arises from the **struggle** to attain it, especially as your **Dark Secret constantly threatens to unravel your progress**. Let the ambition create pressure, desire, and desperation. Characters should move ever closer to their goal—but rarely seize it without cost. However, if a character **does achieve** their ambition during play, they must choose one of two paths:

- **Retire:** The character leaves the game—elevated, fulfilled, or burned out. They may fade into legend, vanish mysteriously, or claim a final, permanent victory.
- **Choose a Greater Ambition:** Replace your original ambition with a **new, bolder goal**. It must be bigger, riskier, and shift your place in the world. A merchant becomes a kingmaker; a revolutionary seeks to crown themselves.

Achieving a Grand Ambition should feel _earned_. Rare. Terrifying.
### Connection to the Others
Each character must define **how they know at least one other character**. This can be direct (an old friend, rival, or former lover) or indirect (you once investigated their family, you’ve only read their work, or you suspect they were involved in something unsavory). Keep it brief but flavorful—just enough to hint at shared history or potential entanglement. These connections don't need to be equal or mutual—your character may think of another fondly while being despised in return.

These connections will ground your letters in shared context, letting tension, trust, or betrayal bloom naturally over time.

#### Some examples:
- To be appointed the next Minister of Trade
- To reclaim a lost family fortune
- To bring modern medicine to a superstitious town
- To discover who really killed the Governor
- To gain the trust of the royal court
- To escape the city and disappear
- To spark a revolution
- To build the tallest tower in the city

The ambition doesn’t have to be noble—it just has to be real. Others **know** this ambition and can support or oppose it.
## Example Character
**Name:** Silas Vale  
**Dark Secret:** Silas is a former cultist who helped summon a forgotten god—he fled before the ritual was complete, and the cult believes he betrayed them.  
**Grand Ambition:** To rise to the position of **Chief Archivist** of the Imperial Library, so he can suppress certain texts and keep them from resurfacing.
**Why does he write letters?**  
Silas writes with court scholars, nobles, and occultists, subtly steering conversations to gain support and ensure the old knowledge stays buried.
**His tone?**  
Polite, flowery, obsessive with small details. Slips easily into theological metaphor. He’s hiding something behind every elegant phrase.
## Tips for Playing
- **Start with a strong voice.** How does your character speak in letters? Formal? Sarcastic? Fearful? Eloquent? Play it consistently.
- **Write with intent.** Every letter is a move toward your ambition—or a reaction to a threat. Don’t ramble without purpose (unless your character would).
- **Reveal slowly.** You know your secret—but don’t blurt it out. Let paranoia creep in. Let small contradictions build tension.
- **React to the world.** Read the World Letter carefully each day. Let it color your words, your fears, your claims.
- **Lie, flatter, manipulate.** Letters are the only way you interact. Use them to charm, mislead, or provoke other players.
- **Don't fear conflict.** It’s a drama, not a debate club. Lean into emotional stakes, misunderstandings, betrayals.
- **Have a handwriting style.** Think about your penmanship, ink color, margins, even postscript habits. It’s part of your persona.
- **Be ready for the end.** If your secret is discovered, you’re out. Let it be a good ending. Dramatic exits are just as satisfying as victories.
