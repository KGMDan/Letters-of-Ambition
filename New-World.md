# A New World
World-building is the backbone of this game, and it must be done **collaboratively**—this is a group effort that will set the tone for your characters’ struggles and ambitions. The game thrives on the interwoven connections between the **characters** and the **world**, so it’s important that everyone has a stake in its creation. Begin with a **live session** (voice or video preferred) to bring the world to life. Everything discussed and decided upon should be carefully noted for future reference.
### The World: Tone & Genre
Before you dive into specific details, decide together the **overall tone** and **genre** of your world. This will guide the narrative style and inform the kind of secrets and ambitions that will drive your characters.
**Questions to Ask:**
- **Is it fantastical or mundane?** Are you playing in a high-fantasy world filled with magic and mythical creatures, or a gritty, grounded world where human ambition and treachery are the only forces at play?
- **What’s the dominant genre?** Choose from genres like:
    - **Magical Fantasy** – Wizards, mystical lands, and ancient prophecies.
    - **Post-Apocalyptic** – A broken world, rebuilding from the ashes of a great catastrophe.
    - **Political Intrigue** – Power struggles between factions, families, and city-states.
    - **Steampunk Noir** – A blend of technology, mystery, and dark, gritty exploration.
    - **Historical Drama** – Set in a real-world historical period but with fictional elements and altered outcomes.
- **What is the overall tone?** Is it hopeful and full of potential? Or dark and oppressive? Is there room for humor, or is everything steeped in tension and drama?
Make sure everyone feels heard—your world should reflect a shared vision that excites everyone at the table!
### The Setting: The City, Town, or Region
Now that you’ve chosen the tone, focus on **where** your characters live. Whether it's a bustling city, a decaying town, or a vast, untamed wilderness, this setting will ground the story and help everyone visualize the world.
**Key Things to Decide Together:**
- **The Geography:** Is the city nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains? On the edge of an ocean or a great forest? How does its location affect life there?
- **Landmarks and Locations:** What are the key places your characters will interact with?
    - The **marketplace**, the **royal palace**, the **black market**, a **hidden library**, or a **burned-out district**?
    - What about natural landmarks like **rivers**, **caves**, or **ancient ruins**?
- **Factions and Power Structures:** Who holds the power in this world? Who calls the shots? Are there:
    - Political factions like rival **noble houses** or a **mercantile guild**?
    - Religious institutions, **secret societies**, or **criminal networks** that hold influence?
    - A **military** presence, **local militia**, or **city watch**?
- **History & Lore:** What’s the past of the region or city? Has it faced any major events that shaped it? Was there a **great war**, an **empire** that fell, or a **plague** that decimated the population? Knowing the history will help frame the stakes and motivations of characters.
### Flashpoints: Points of Conflict

Flashpoints are **potential sources of tension** that can drive the story forward. They are the explosive events that may come into play later in the game and cause characters to clash, collaborate, or struggle.

**What to Establish Together:**
- **Social Unrest:** Are there uprisings or revolts among the common folk, perhaps due to **economic inequality** or **oppression** by a ruling class?
- **Political Succession:** Is there a throne to be claimed, an election, or a **dynastic struggle** for power? Perhaps a ruler is dead, and several factions want their candidate to take over.
- **Forbidden Knowledge or Magic:** Is there knowledge that could tear the world apart? Or an ancient **artifact** or **forbidden magic** that’s being sought by several groups, each with their own agenda?
- **Unstable Magic or Technology:** Does the use of magic or tech risk a **cataclysmic failure**? Are there **rogue wizards**, **mad scientists**, or **dangerous experiments** that could threaten the city or region?
- **Economic Collapse or Crisis:** Is the economy teetering on the brink of collapse? **Famine**, **trade disruptions**, or **inflation** could create chaos in the city.
- **Intrigue and Secrets:** Is there a hidden conspiracy within the ruling class, or are certain **secrets** threatening to be exposed?

Flashpoints should be **active** and **unresolved**—things that could flare up at any moment. They give the characters something to _react_ to and fuel the narrative.
### Role of the Host & Rotation
The **Host** plays a central role in moving the story forward and shaping the world through the **World Letter** each week. It’s important to decide, as a group, who will be the first Host and how the role will rotate.
**How to Rotate the Host Role:**
- **First Host:** The **first Host** should be chosen by the group at the beginning. This player will guide the initial **world-building session** and write the first batch of World Letters.
- **Rotation:** Decide how the Host will rotate each week. You could rotate it alphabetically, by character’s role in the story (e.g., a major faction leader might take the role first), or randomly.
    - **Weekly Rotation:** Every week, the Host draws the cards for the **World Letter** and **Character Letters**, sets the scene, and provides prompts.
    - **The Host's Power:** The Host’s World Letter should subtly tie into their own character or ambitions, pulling others into their story. But they must also avoid dominating the narrative—let others push back or affect the world!
### Final Tips for Building the World
- **Record Everything:** Keep detailed notes of your world-building decisions, especially important landmarks, factions, flashpoints, and rules. This will provide continuity and a reference point when writing letters.
- **Create a Shared Document:** Consider keeping a shared document, wiki, or map where you can track key events, characters, and evolving storylines.
- **Stay Flexible:** The world is a living entity. As the game progresses, it should evolve based on character actions, secrets, and ambitions.
