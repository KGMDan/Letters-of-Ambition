# The Host & World Letters
Each week, one player becomes the **Host**—a rotating role that guides the shared world. As Host, you become the **narrator of reality**, writing **the world** letter as well as your normal character letter.
### World Letter
**The World Letter is the heartbeat of the setting.** It’s a daily broadcast from the world itself—objective, indirect, and textured with detail. It's not written in your character’s voice, but rather in the voice of **society, rumor, or formal report.**
#### Think of it like:
- A **front-page newspaper article**
- A **gossip column** from a well-placed informant
- A **clerical notice** from a local magistrate
- A **radio report** or **town crier’s summary**
- A **manifesto**, **surveillance log**, or **minutes from a secret meeting**

Your job is to present what has **changed** in the world—subtle shifts, rising tensions, or dramatic events. This gives all players something to **react to or be influenced by**.

> **Important:** The World Letter must be sent **first each week** (ideally early Monday), giving players a shared base to draw inspiration from when writing their letters.
### How to Write a Good World Letter
**Be Concrete. Be Sensory. Be Suggestive.**
- Use **specific details** to describe events—locations, names, times, weather, objects left behind.
- Stay **neutral** in tone. You’re not writing what _you_ think happened—you’re writing what _was observed or reported_.
- Leave **gaps** for interpretation. Players will use your details to spin lies, truths, or conspiracy. That’s good.
### What Can Go in a World Letter?
Here are some narrative elements you can draw on each day or spread across the week:
#### Setting Events
- A fire broke out in the market district.
- A foreign ship docked in the harbor with sealed cargo.
- A noble family announces a sudden engagement.
- Strange lights seen above the chapel at midnight.
#### Rumors & Whispers
- An anonymous letter circulating high society.
- A factory worker claims to have seen a ghost.
- Children singing a nursery rhyme with unsettling new verses.
- "They say the Mayor hasn't left his office in days..."
#### Flashpoints in Motion
Return to the **Flashpoints** your group defined during Session Zero—the political tension, magical imbalance, or cultural unrest. Start turning the screws. 
##### Examples:
- “Tensions between the guilds rise after a strike halts the salt trade.”
- “The strange red mist over the Northern Fens has spread into the outer farms.”
- “A royal inspector is due to arrive next week. Some fear what he’ll uncover.”

Flashpoints should simmer and escalate slowly—players may try to accelerate or contain them through their actions.
#### The Host's [Card Draw](https://github.com/KGMDan/Letters-of-Ambition/blob/main/Cards.md)
The Host also draws a card for the World Letter, just like everyone else. The **suit and value** affect how intense or themed the events are:

- A **6 of Diamonds** might mean a moderate financial disruption—a loan called in, or a scandal involving wealth.
- A **Jack of Clubs** might hint at unseen threats—a shadowy group moving beneath the surface.
- An **Ace of Spades** could demand you introduce a revelation that threatens _someone’s_ secret. You might not know whose—but the players will. This is also a fun way to hint at the player your on-to them!

> 💡 Tip: If you draw a Joker, make it **big and unmistakable**. A plague, a comet, a divine vision, a building collapse. Something that alters the entire city’s rhythm.

### Connect Your Character
Each World Letter should include **a subtle or direct mention of the Host’s character**—a reference, rumor, quote, or sighting that gives the other players a reason to reach out. It doesn’t need to be dramatic; a passing mention in a tavern gossip column or a vague implication in a political decree is enough. This thread invites others to respond, challenge, or scheme against your character in their own letters.

The best world letters do more than describe events—they pull people into them.
### Final Advice for Hosts
- Think of yourself as a **stage manager**. You don't control the plot—you move the props, dim the lights, and ring the bells that draw attention.
- Let the **players steer the drama**. You're not there to decide outcomes, only to describe ripples.
- Keep a **log** of events for future Hosts to refer to. This builds continuity and texture across weeks.
- Don't resolve player actions. Present consequences and changes, but avoid saying, “Because of what Player X did…” Instead, let the world reflect possible outcomes and let the table interpret them.
- Vary the **voice** and **style**. One week the world might speak through elegant newsprint; another, through grubby underground posters.
## Example World Letter
 **The Gilded Lantern — Vol. IX, Issue 142**
_The Independent Voice of New Viridia_  **Tuesday, 6th of Emberwane**

**Docks Sealed Following “Routine Inspection” — Trade Routes Disrupted**

Late last night, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs announced an “unscheduled quarantine” across three major wharves after officials boarded the _Sea Chantress_, a trade vessel out of Kaleph Bay. The inspection, which began at dusk, lasted well into the morning and concluded with the vessel’s hold being sealed under royal sigil.

Dockworkers interviewed by _The Lantern_ reported “a smell like rusted brass” and “odd chanting” emanating from below deck, though ministry officials deny any spiritual or thaumaturgic cause for concern.

The closure has already delayed the unloading of key goods, including ink shipments from the southern isles and a crate of high-value violet coal marked for the Ironsilk Guild. Merchants in the Hall of Exchanges expressed frustration this morning, citing mounting tariffs and long-unpaid fees. “If this is routine,” said Agna Ferros of Ferros Freight, “then routine is bleeding us dry.”

**Spymaster’s Nephew Appointed to Civil Archive, Eyebrows Raised**

Marien Allweather, a previously unknown clerk from the outer boroughs, has been appointed Acting Coordinator of the Central Archive following the sudden resignation of Archivist Brindle (see yesterday’s issue). While the Ministry claims the transition is “temporary,” sources within the Archive whisper of rooms being sealed, records re-indexed, and certain correspondence removed from public access entirely.

Allweather is known—uncomfortably—to be the nephew of the Royal Spymaster, Dame Ilreth Raithe, whose influence in civil appointments has come under increased scrutiny since the Fogtower Incident.

Is it efficiency, nepotism, or something altogether darker? Our readers will no doubt decide.

**Oddities in the Commons**

- The statue of Makarus the Lawgiver was found seated rather than standing. The marble base was unmoved.
- A minor bureaucrat in District 6 attempted to translate a city ordinance into birdsong. It is unclear whether he succeeded.
- An anonymous flyer has begun appearing in alleyways across the West Quarter. It reads only: “**Speak less. Watch more.**”

**Flashpoint Watch**
- **The Redsteel Lockout** continues, with striking workers maintaining barricades near the South Rail. Food and fuel run low.
- **Witchglass Syndrome** cases are rising again in Old Newmere. Officials deny links to the collapsed thaumaturgy tower.
- The **Eclipsed Prince**, long rumored dead, was seen (allegedly) boarding a tram toward the Magistrate’s Row. Witness was “extremely certain” and also “slightly intoxicated.”

**Editor’s Note:**  
Letters to the Editor must now be submitted in person, via sealed envelope, to our office at the corner of Crowspar and Aldwyn. All correspondence will be reviewed for seditious charmwork.
